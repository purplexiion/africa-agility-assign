    <p>Clay Olsen is the CEO and Founder of Impact Suite, which owns and operates a suite of award-winning self-care apps that have helped hundreds of thousands of individuals find deeper healing and recovery in over 150 countries. Early in his career, he co-founded and lead the creation of Fight the New Drug—a youth movement dedicated to raising awareness on the harmful effects of pornography and other forms of sexual exploitation through science, facts, and personal accounts. He now sits on the board of directors and helps guide the larger vision</p>
    <h5>Apps included in the Impact Suite:</h5>
    <ul>
    <li>Fortify</li>
    <li>Fight the New Drug</li>
</ul>
    <p>Fight the New Drug works to shine a light on the underbelly of pornography and, as Clay describes it, “not to limit the supply, but rather to decrease the demand.” </p>
    <p>To start off his explanation, Clay shares a personal experience of a cousin of his had an extreme addiction to pornography since a young age. As his cousin aged, he started to act out in inappropriate, escalating to illegal, ways that ultimately put him in prison, and when he was released and asked what lead him to believe these things were acceptable, he claimed that a lot of his beliefs stemmed from his addiction to pornography.This lead him to question whether there was scientific evidence behind addictions to pornography. After Clay and some other friends from college came together and realized that they all had either direct or indirect relationships to pornography, they decided to do some research. So, after reading and searching for answers, they found some: he and his friends realized that there is an extreme neurological impact that porn can have on the brain, similar to the way that the brain responds to drugs. So, when starting—more specifically, naming—the organization, the founders realized that the best way to approach it would to highlight the addictive pattern that it can have on an individual, rather than the shame and guilt that it can bring.
        Probably a good call.Fight the New Drug started around 10 years ago, and at the start they knew they wanted to start it more as a public health concern rather than a moralistic or political issue. And while they think that there are some legislative laws that could come into play, FTND stands to frame pornography as an addictive pattern to be helped versus speicficallu a moral issue. It seeks to bring together anyone and everyone that has struggled with addiction, which can affect ANYBODY: conservative or liberal, tall or short, male or female. Anybody. </p>
        <h3>HOW CAN PORNOGRAPHY BE AN ADDICTION LIKE A DRUG?</h3>
    <p>SO many books have come out that reveal the addictive nature of pornography. In fact, over the last decade, 39 out of 39 neurological studies that have confirmed pornography as addictive. And he’s not talking about your local neighborhood evangelist conducting “studies” out of their church and passing them as fact. These studies have come from institutions like Cambridge, Yale, Max Planck Instituted for Human Development in Berlin… big deal neurologists. In one of her studies, Dr. Valerie Voon from Cambridge, who studies addictive behavior for a living, said that when comparing the brain scans of drug addicts and people with sexual compulsivity due to pornography they are the same. Because, at the end of the day, when it comes to the brain addiction is addiction.
    It really does come down to science. We have a reward pathway in our brain in which pleasure chemicals in our brain—dopamine, epinephrine, oxytocin, serotonin—are released. When we introduce drugs or any other kind of addictive behavior, it triggers that pathway to the point where the things that we used to enjoy no longer stimulate us. Therefore, the further the addiction continues, the more we need to expose ourselves to our addiction, whatever it may be. So, over time, that part of our brain is altered and rewired.
    Now, we’ve known about that #science for a while. However, what is coming into light more—some of which is due to FTND—is that this same process occurs with sexual compulsivity as well, and pornography is a very powerful force that taps into one of our most primal urges: sex. And now that we know more about the reality of neuroplasticity—which is the brain’s ability to literally restructure itself by forming new neural pathways and connections over time—it means that our brains are constantly adapting and molding according to what we do, say, think, watch etc... This is GREAT for learning, say, an instrument or a language because we can rehearse and practice over time to learn better. This can also used against us as we can develop bad habits with this, and that’s what is being seen with these behavioral and chemical addictions. However, it is definitely possible to relearn healthy behavior after addictions. And the sooner we catch it, the easier it is to heal.</p>
